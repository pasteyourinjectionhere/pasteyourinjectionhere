## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŒ±

- Currently working on assignments and a ASVS v12 file upload auditor script in Python and AWK.
- Currently learning xv6 and getting more familiar with C.
- Might be keen to collaborate on the ASVS v12 file upload auditor.
- Ask me about C pointers, I love them, but sometimes when I think I know them, C throws a curve ball at me and I'm like "huh?".
